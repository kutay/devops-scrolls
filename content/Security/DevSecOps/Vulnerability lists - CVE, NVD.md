# CVE

## History

The CVE List was launched by MITRE as a community effort in 1999.



## CVE lifecycle

https://www.cve.org/About/Process#CVERecordLifecycle



## CWE and CVE

At first glance, CWE and CVE seems similar, but there is a major difference.

- **CWE** stands for *Common Weakness Enumeration*, and has to do with the vulnerability—not the instance within a product or system.
- **CVE** stands for *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*, and has to do with the specific instance within a product or system—not the underlying flaw

Essentially, CWE is a “dictionary” of software vulnerabilities, while CVE is a list of known instances of vulnerability for specific products or systems.

## CVSS and CWSS

We also need a scoring system for vulnerabilities. 

- **CVSS** stands for *Common Vulnerability Scoring System*, and is used to score the severity of a vulnerability
- **CWSS** stands for *Common Weakness Scoring System*, and ranks the severity of software weaknesses


## CVE and NVD

The CVE List was launched by MITRE as a community effort in 1999, and the U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD) was launched by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2005.

- CVE - A list of records—each containing an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference—for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. CVE Records are used in numerous cybersecurity products and services from around the world, including NVD.
- NVD - A vulnerability database built upon and fully synchronized with the CVE List so that any updates to CVE appear immediately in NVD.

The CVE List feeds NVD, which then builds upon the information included in CVE Records to provide enhanced information for each record such as fix information, severity scores, and impact ratings. 
As part of its enhanced information, NVD also provides advanced searching features such as by OS; by vendor name, product name, and/or version number; and by vulnerability type, severity, related exploit range, and impact.
